    """
    Trains a specific classification model based on the provided model type and parameters.

    Parameters:
    - X_train (array-like): The training input samples.
    - Y_train (array-like): The target labels for classification.
    - model_type (int): Specifies the type of classification model to be trained.
        1 for Logistic Regression, 2 for Support Vector Machine (SVM), 3 for Naive Bayes,
        4 for Random Forest, 5 for AdaBoost, 6 for XGBoost, and 7 for Gradient Boosting.
    - model_params (dict, optional): A dictionary of parameters for the model. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
    - model: The trained model object based on the specified type.
